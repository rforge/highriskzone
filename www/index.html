<h1> Determine high-risk zones in R </h1>
<div id="h1sub">R package <tt>osmar</tt></div>

<p>The highriskzone-package provides tools to determine and evaluate high-risk zones 
of unobserved events using point process methodology. There are three methods implemented: 
the method of fixed radius, the quantile-based method  and the intensity-based method. <p>

<p> The package is based on "Determining high-risk zones for unexploded World War II bombs by 
using point process methodology" by Mahling et al. published in Journal of the Royal 
Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics)
(see http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2012.01055.x/abstract).</p>
