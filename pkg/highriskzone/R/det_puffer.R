#' Estimation of width of a guard region given an estimated highriskzone
#'
#' \code{det_guard_width} determines the necessary width of a guard region in which
#' the existence of additional observed bomb craters could change a intensity based estimated 
#' highriskzone within the evaluation area of interest.
#' Within the evaluation area, the high risk zone consists of all points at which the estimated 
#' intensity of unexploded bombs exceeds a certain, specified or estimated threshold c. At a given 
#' point s, the intensity of unexploded bombs is given by the sum of all evaluated bivariate normal kernels
#' centered at the observed bomb craters multiplied by a constant nxprob/1-nxprob.
#' If the estimated intensity of unexploaded bombs is zero at a point at the boarder of the evaluation area
#' an additional observation outside the area could lift the intensity only above the determined threshold if the 
#' distance to the boarder is small enough so that the density of the normal kernel (which is centered at the additional 
#' observation) is bigger than the threshold at the boarder (assuming that the estimated kernel doesn't change due to the 
#' additional observation). The function returns the biggest distance in which it is possible that the density of
#' the bivariate normal kernel of the intensity of the supplied highriskzone exceeds thresh_const times the threshold
#' of the highriskzone. If thresh_const is set to 1, the guard region is the smallest region with constant width around 
#' the evaluation area in which a single additional observation could (but not necessarily does) increase the 
#' highriskzone within the evaluation area at a point at the boarder if the intensity of unexploaded bombs was zero at this point before. 
#' If the intensity was >0 at a point at the boarder of the evaluation area, or more than 1 additional observations
#' are found nearby outside of the evaluation area, the highriskzone within the evaluation area could already expand  
#' by addditional observations with a bigger distance from the boarder. This can be considered by setting thresh_const < 1, 
#' which intuitively means that 1/thresh_const crater observation at the same point could expand the highriskzone within 
#' the evaluation area in the direction of the additional observations, or that a point the boarder becomes part of the highriskzone
#' by the observation of a single additional crater if the intensity at this point was thresh_cont times the highriskzone threshold
#' based on all crater observations within the evaluation area.
