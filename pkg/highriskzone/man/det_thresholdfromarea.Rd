\title{Determination of alpha and the threshold c which results
in a high-risk zone with desired area.}
\usage{
det_thresholdfromarea(intens, areahrz, win, nxprob = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{intens}{estimated intensity of the observed process (object of class "im", see \code{\link[spatstat]{density.ppp}})}

\item{areahrz}{area of the high-risk zone}

\item{win}{observation window}

\item{nxprob}{probability of having unbserved events}
}
\value{
A list of
  \item{ threshold }{ Value of the threshold c. The high-risk zone is the field in which the estimated intensity
                  exceeds this value }
  \item{ calccutoff }{ failure probability alpha for given area; probability to have at least unobserved event outside the high-risk zone }
}
\description{
This function is used for the intensity-based method. Used in function det_hrz.
