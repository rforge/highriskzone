\title{Estimation of width of a guard region given an estimated highriskzone
\code{det_guard_width} determines the necessary width of a guard region in which
the existence of additional observed bomb craters could change a intensity based estimated 
highriskzone within the evaluation area of interest.
Within the evaluation area, the high risk zone consists of all points at which the estimated 
intensity of unexploded bombs exceeds a certain, specified or estimated threshold c. At a given 
point s, the intensity of unexploded bombs is given by the sum of all evaluated bivariate normal kernels
centered at the observed bomb craters multiplied by a constant nxprob/1-nxprob.
If the estimated intensity of unexploaded bombs is zero at a point at the boarder of the evaluation area
an additional observation outside the area could lift the intensity only above the determined threshold if the 
distance to the boarder is small enough so that the density of the normal kernel (which is centered at the additional 
observation) is bigger than the threshold at the boarder (assuming that the estimated kernel doesn't change due to the 
additional observation). The function returns the biggest distance in which it is possible that the density of
the bivariate normal kernel of the intensity of the supplied highriskzone exceeds thresh_const times the threshold
of the highriskzone. If thresh_const is set to 1, the guard region is the smallest region with constant width around 
the evaluation area in which a single additional observation could (but not necessarily does) increase the 
highriskzone within the evaluation area at a point at the boarder if the intensity of unexploaded bombs was zero at this point before. 
If the intensity was >0 at a point at the boarder of the evaluation area, or more than 1 additional observations
are found nearby outside of the evaluation area, the highriskzone within the evaluation area could already expand  
by addditional observations with a bigger distance from the boarder. This can be considered by setting thresh_const < 1, 
which intuitively means that 1/thresh_const crater observation at the same point could expand the highriskzone within 
the evaluation area in the direction of the additional observations, or that a point the boarder becomes part of the highriskzone
by the observation of a single additional crater if the intensity at this point was thresh_cont times the highriskzone threshold
based on all crater observations within the evaluation area.}
