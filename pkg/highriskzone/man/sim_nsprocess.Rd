\title{Simulation of the Neyman-Scott process.}
\usage{
  sim_nsprocess(ppdata, intens, radius, clustering = 5,
    thinning = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ppdata}{observed point pattern whose estimated
  intensity (adjusted for thinning and divided by
  "clustering") is used for simulating the parent process}

  \item{intens}{estimated intensity}

  \item{radius}{radius of the circles around the parent
  points in which the cluster points are located (Maximum
  radius of a random cluster)}

  \item{clustering}{a value larger or equal 1 which
  describes the amount of clustering; the adjusted
  estimated intensity of the observed pattern is divided by
  this value; it is also the parameter of the Poisson
  distribution for the number of points per cluster}

  \item{thinning}{constant thinning probability (in case
  the observed pattern is a thinned version of a full
  pattern); usually equal to the probability of having
  unobserved events}
}
\value{
  The simulated point pattern (an object of class "ppp").
  Additionally, some intermediate results of the simulation
  are returned as attributes of this point pattern: see
  \code{\link[spatstat]{rNeymanScott}}.
}
\description{
  Simulation of the Neyman-Scott process. Only applicable
  if the intensity was estimated for an appropriately
  enlarged window. More details in \code{sim_nsppp}.
