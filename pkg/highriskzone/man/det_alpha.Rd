\title{calculation of alpha (failure probability), when having the threshold c}
\usage{
det_alpha(intens, threshold, nxprob = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{intens}{estimated intensity of the observed process
  (object of class "im", see
  \code{\link[spatstat]{density.ppp}})}

  \item{threshold}{threshold c: The high-risk zone is the
  field in which the estimated intensity exceeds this
  value.}

  \item{nxprob}{probability of having unobserved events}
}
\value{
value of alpha
}
\description{
This function is used for the intensity-based method. It
determines the probability to have at least one unobserved
event outside the high-risk zone. A Poisson distribution is
used for the number of unobserved events in a certain area
or field. Used in functions det_threshold,
det_thresholdfromarea.
