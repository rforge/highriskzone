}
\arguments{
  \item{numit}{Number of iterations}

  \item{simulate}{The type of simulation, can be one of
  \code{"thinning", "intens"} or \code{"clintens"}}

  \item{radiusClust}{(Optional) radius of the circles
  around the parent points in which the cluster points are
  located. Only used for \code{simulate = "clintens"}.}

  \item{clustering}{a value >= 1 which describes the amount
  of clustering; the adjusted estimated intensity of the
  observed pattern is divided by this value; it also is the
  parameter of the Poisson distribution for the number of
  points per cluster. Only used for \code{simulate =
  "clintens"}.}

  \item{pbar}{logical. Should progress bar be printed?}

  \item{ppdata}{Observed spatial point process of class
  ppp.}

  \item{type}{Method to use, can be one of
  \code{"dist"}(method of fixed radius or quantile-based
  method), or \code{"intens"}(intensity-based method)}

  \item{criterion}{criterion to limit the high-risk zone,
  can be one of \code{"area"} (giving size of hrz),
  \code{"indirect"} (giving quantile/alpha depending on
  type), or \code{"direct"} (giving radius/threshold c
  depending on type)}

  \item{cutoff}{Value of criterion (area, radius, quantile,
  alpha or threshold).  Depending on criterion and type: If
  criterion = "direct" cutoff is the threshold. If
  criterion = "indirect" cutoff is the quantile for the
  quantile-based method and the failure probability alpha
  for the intensity-base method. If criterion = "area"
  cutoff is the area the high-risk zone should have.}

  \item{nxprob}{Probability of having unobserved events.
  Default value is 0.1.}

  \item{distancemap}{(optional) distance map: distance of
  every pixel to the nearest observation of the point
  pattern; only needed for \code{type="dist"}. If not
  given, it will be computed by
  \code{\link[spatstat]{distmap}}.}

  \item{intens}{(optional) estimated intensity of the
  observed process (object of class "im"), only needed for
  type="intens". If not given, it will be estimated using
  \code{\link[spatstat]{density.ppp}}.}

  \item{covmatrix}{(optional) Covariance matrix of the
  kernel of a normal distribution, only needed for
  \code{type="intens"} if no intensity is given. If not
  given, it will be estimated using
  \code{\link[ks]{Hscv}}.}

\description{
  Evaluates the performance of the three methods: \itemize{
  \item Method of fixed radius \item Quantile-based method
  \item Intensity-based method } For further details on the
  metods, see \code{\link{det_hrz}} or the paper of Mahling
  et al. (2012)(References). \cr There are three ways to
  simulate data for the evaluation.
}
\details{
  The three simulation types are: \describe{ \item{
  Data-based simulation }{ Here a given data set is used.
  The data set is being thinned as explaned below.  Note,
  that this method is very different to the others, since
  it is using the real data.  } \item{ Simulation of an
  inhomogeneous Poisson process }{ Here an inhomogeneous
  Poisson process is simulated and then that data is
  thinned.  } \item{ Simulation of a Neyman-Scott process
  }{ Here a Neyman-Scott process is simulated (see
  \code{\link{sim_nsppp}},
  \code{\link[spatstat]{rNeymanScott}}) and this data is
  then also thinned.  } } Thinning:\cr Let \eqn{X} be the
  spatial point process, which is the location of all
  events and let \eqn{Y} be a subset of \eqn{X} describing
  the observed process. The process of unobserved events
  then is \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{Z = X \setminus Y}}{Z = X \
  Y} , meaning that \eqn{Z} and \eqn{Y} are disjoint and
  together forming \eqn{X}.\cr Since \eqn{Z} is not known,
  in this function an observed or simulated spatial point
  pattern \code{ppdata} is taken as the full pattern (which
  we denote by \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde X}}{X'})
  comprising the observed events \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde
  Y}}{Y'} as well as the unobserved
  \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde Z}}{Z'}. Each event in
  \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde X}}{X'} is assigned to one of
  the two processes \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde Y}}{Y'} or
  \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde Z}}{Z'} by drawing independent
  Bernoulli random numbers. \cr The resulting process of
  observed events \ifelse{latex}{\eqn{\tilde Y}}{Y'} is
  used to determine the high-risk zone. Knowing now the
  unobserved process, it can be seen how many events are
  outside and inside the high-risk zone.\cr

  \code{type} and \code{criterion} may be vectors in this
  function.
